To do list
1. add kong movement animation for when enemy chases player
2. add kong attack animation for when enemy catches player
3. add banana image, this is what player has to obtain
4. implement code for enemy moving vertically, enemy has 
to get to an empty slot on the platform before he can move on to the lower or higher level


Future aims of game
Player has to obtain a set amount of bananas within a set time limit

The bananas can appear on the ground or on the platforms, the bananas are only there for a set number of seconds 
before they disappear. Note if the bananas appear on the ground the enemy can not follow.

Considering having a bonus time increase, e.g. if player gets bonus image then they get x extra seconds on game.
